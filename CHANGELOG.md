## Versioning

servo follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Because this is a Go
module, a MAJOR bump also changes the import path — `github.com/okian/servo/vN` — per
[Go's own modules convention](https://go.dev/doc/modules/major-version). That convention is the
whole point: it's what stops `go get -u`, or any caret/latest-compatible version constraint, from
ever silently handing an existing consumer a backwards-incompatible release under a path they
already depend on. A release's tag and its import path's version suffix always match.

**Breaking (forces the next `/vN` bump):** any change to `servo` or `servotest`'s exported API —
signatures, types, or documented behavior, including a marker function starting or ceasing to
panic; any change to a CLI command's flags, subcommands, or exit-code contract that an existing
`servo check` CI step might depend on; any change to generated code's public method set (`New`,
`Run`, `Shutdown`, `Health`, `Ready`, `Graph`, `Report` and their signatures).

**Not breaking:** regenerating a stale `servo_gen.go` is always expected and cheap, so a change to
generated code's internal shape, field names, or formatting is not itself a breaking change as
long as the public methods above keep their signatures — consumers regenerate, they don't hand-edit
that file. Also not breaking: new capability interfaces, new CLI subcommands or flags, improved
diagnostic wording, or a case that used to be a diagnostic now resolving successfully.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-27

### Changed
- **Breaking — module path**: `github.com/okian/servo/v2` → `github.com/okian/servo/v3`. This
  release shares no API with anything previously published under `/v2`, for the reason below.

### Added
- Complete rewrite: build-time dependency resolution and code generation, replacing the runtime
  lifecycle sequencer previously published under `github.com/okian/servo` and
  `github.com/okian/servo/v2` (global registry, hand-maintained `order int`,
  `Initialize(ctx) error` with no parameters). See [README.md](README.md) for usage and
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how it's built.
- `servo migrate` reads the old `Register(X{}, N)` calls and emits a starting skeleton for the new
  spec-file format, plus a report flagging duplicate order values for manual review.
